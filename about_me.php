                <p class="mr-5 desc">Hello, my name is Elexis Falceso. I am currently studying for my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Cavite State University - Silang Campus, and I am 4th year of college.</p>
                <p class="mr-5 desc">Embarking on the exciting journey of web development has become a passion and a continuous learning experience for me. I thoroughly enjoy the process of translating lines of code into visually appealing and functional digital experiences. One of my recent projects was dedicated to the creation of a responsive e-commerce website, where I skillfully integrated front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a seamless user interface. Delving into back-end development, I employed frameworks like PHP and Sometimes Asp.Net and Express to proficiently manage server-side functionalities and handle data transactions. The iterative cycle of debugging, optimizing, and staying updated on the latest web technologies not only fuels my enthusiasm but also strengthens my dedication to crafting innovative and user-friendly online platforms.</p>
                <p class="mr-5 desc">My primary career goal is to excel as a Full Stack Web Developer to Future, combining my passion for both front-end and back-end development. I aspire to contribute to innovative projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies, creating seamless and user-friendly web experiences. My academic journey is focused on acquiring a solid foundation in computer science, software engineering, and relevant programming languages. Professionally, I aim to work in dynamic environments that foster creativity and continuous learning. Ultimately, I envision myself playing a pivotal role in developing robust web applications and contributing to the evolution of the tech industry</p>
